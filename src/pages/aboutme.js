                    <h4>About Me</h4>
                    <p> Welcome to my About Me page!</p>
                    <p> I graduated from Luther College in Decorah Iowa in May of 2016.
                    During my time at Luther, I became more passionate about education and discovered talents I didnâ€™t think I had! This led me to start taking computer science classes,
                     and to eventually dedicate myself to coding and continuous learning. And a smile as I contribute to solving problems!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    After college I was employed in banking as an account processor where I developed my coding talents, taking on odds projects until I was asked to help the automation team,
                     in which I was coached in agile and learned the Automation Anywhere framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My main skill that I can bring to any job is my interest and ability to learn! This has taken 
                    me everywhere from learning music to studying computer programming concepts, operating systems, and languages. 
                    </p>

                                    In high school, I was in 3 different bands that ranged from pop punk to country music.

                                    I learned how to hypnotize people as a way to meet people during high school and college.

                                    I play quite a few instruments with my favorites being Guitar, Piano, and Drum Kit.

                                    I've recently taken up Tennis as a hobby. I am not good.
